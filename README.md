Rock paper scissors, or otherwise known as Rochambeau/ Roshambo

Played against the computer, set in a desert world

5 rounds of games played to the natural tempo of the game in real life

    I went in blind, without looking at other submissions at
    https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors
    and actually without looking past the initial mention of the game when it was just meant to be a CLI game.. so I may have deviated a bit from later         instruction, which I'll find out shortly.
    Effort was put into getting timing right in my game, because I felt it to be a key element when playing the game in real life

    I knew pretty much nothing about Javascript before this, so it taught me a lot
    Parallax, setTimeout, DOM manipulation, cross browser compatability, scroll events
    event listeners, animation on DOM manipulation, debugging...etc etc


DESKTOP
Use chrome for best experience, but Edge, Safari and Firefox still run quite well. 
Coded for 1920x1080 res, but roughly tweaked for 2560

    Safari has a funny font and filter variance
    Firefox doesnt return to top of page when refreshed, only when initially loaded
    Edge actually looks fine
    Havent tested on other browsers


MOBILE
Not recommended on mobile.
As it stands, mobile styling needs to be tweaked, the margins/positions are off and overflowX needs attention
    
    Will return to address these issues once I've gotten further into the TOP course.
